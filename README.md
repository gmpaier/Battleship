# Battleship

We were talking among ourselves and talking about our interests and video games, and we created a Battleship type game to keep players entertained.

## User Story
If you are someone who is still stuck at home due to Covid, why not spend some time online with friends and play some videogames. Whether you are someone who is bored looking to pass some time, or a coding student looking to test and improve your skills, this is a game that allows someone to play other users in a game of Battleship.

## Usage
#Demo 

## Game App Directions
Upon entering the page, the user signs up and logs in in order to keep track of a players stats
The user then decides whether to find a friend to challenge to a game, or just start a new game against a random opponent
Player should be able to place ships in thier desired location on their board
Player clicks on a square to 'shoot' at the opponents board to try and sink their ships
First player to have all of thier ships hit and sunk, loses.

## Problem It Solves
This game app provides players entertainment and a way to disconnect for some time. It could allow for people to make friends through the chat feature, or blow off some steam by shooting at some ships.

## Challenges
Getting the 2 player servers to talk to each other and respond to moves
Placing ships on the board
Remembering the GIT process took some time.
Finding the new technology that would help
    Planned on using Websockets (two way connection) and ServerSet Events (one way connection). If starting project over we would start using Websockets for the start

## Successes
Delagation of responsibilities - We each took something we knew we could do
Getting a functioning 2 player game and getting the servers to talk to each other


## Future Features
In the future we would like to keep a database for each user with player stats, including wins, loses, and games played.
Using Websockets to lessen the CPU load
